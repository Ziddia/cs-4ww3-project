All pages should have some options in a navbar - the options should be different depending on whether the user is logged in or not. but this isn't something that will matter for part 1.
- If user is not logged in, show options for Log In, Register, Search Objects.
- If user is logged in, show options for Log Out, Search Objects, Submit Object.


index.html - Home page, provide overview of functionality.
-- this should be reachable from navbar (e.g. clicking on logo?)

search.html - Allows any user (logged in or not) to search for objects by different criteria.
-- required to search by name and rating, but I would also like to search by location or other options
-- this will be accessible by navbar at all times
-- running a search from this page would take to results.html (or results_sample.html in A1)

results_sample.html - Sample results from a search from search.html
-- Displays a listing of all objects matching the search with a click-through link to individual.html (individual_sample.html in A1)
-- Should probably have methods to filter down the remaining objects further.
-- Needs to show results on a map (google maps API?)

individual_sample.html - Sample individual object details from a result in results.html (results_sample.html)
-- Should display object details, ratings, reviews... plus map of object location

submission.html - Method to submit a new object to the database, reachable via navbar
-- Should be a simple form, to submit a new object
-- Some sort of checking would need to be implemented to identify duplicates
-- Should redirect to the object after it's submitted successfully

registration.html - Register an account, reachable via navbar

login.html - Log in to account, reachable via navbar
-- might not be needed past A1, if JS solutions are better
